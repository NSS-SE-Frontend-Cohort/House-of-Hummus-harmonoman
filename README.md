# Events and State Self-Assessment

> ðŸ§¨ Make sure you answer the vocabulary and understanding questions at the end of this document before notifying your coaches that you are done with the project

## Setup

1. Make sure you are in your `workspace` directory
1. `git clone {github repo SSH string}`
1. `cd` into the directory it creates
1. `code .` to open the project code
1. Use the `serve` command to start the web server
1. Open the URL provided in Chrome

## Requirements

### Initial Render

1. All 10 base dishes should be displayed as radio input options.
1. All 9 vegetables should be displayed as radio input options.
1. All 6 side dishes should be displayed as radio input options.
1. All previously purchased meals should be displayed below the meal options. Each purchase should display the primary key and the total cost of the purcahsed meal.

### State Management

1. When the user selects an item in any of the three columns, the choice should be stored as transient state.
1. When a user makes a choice for all three kinds of food, and then clicks the "Purchase Combo" button, a new sales object should be...
    1. Stored as permanent state in your local API.
    1. Represented as HTML below the **Monthly Sales** header in the following format **_exactly_**. Your output will not have zeroes, but the actual amount.
        ```html
        Receipt #1 = $00.00
        ```
   1. The user's choices should be cleared from transient state once the purchase is made.

## Design

Given the description and animation above...

1. Create an ERD for this application before you begin.
1. Make a list of what modules need to be created to make your application as modular as possible. Create a **Dependency Graph** for the project to be reviewed once you are complete with the assessment.
1. Create a **Sequence Diagram** that visualizes what your algorithm is for this project. We'll give you a minimal starting point.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Main
    Main->>Vegetables: Generate vegetable options
    Vegetables-->>Main: Here are some radio buttons
    participant Vegetables
    participant TransientState
    TransientState->>API: Save this dinner order
    API-->>TransientState: Order saved
    participant API
```

## Vocabulary and Understanding

> ðŸ§¨ Before you click the "Assessment Complete" button on the Learning Platform, add your answers below for each question and make a commit. It is your option to request a face-to-face meeting with a coach for a vocabulary review.

1. Should transient state be represented in a database diagram? Why, or why not?
   > No because the data is held temporarily not persistently in a long-term database, and an ERD is meant for representing persistent data.

2. In the **FoodTruck** module, you are **await**ing the invocation of all of the component functions _(e.g. sales, veggie options, etc.)_. Why must you use the `await` keyword there? Explain what happens if you remove it.
   > We are using `await` because we are making sure that the functions we are fetching data asynchronously wait until the `Promise` has been filled from the API before building the HTML, otherwise you will only get [object Promise] in your UI.

3. When the user is making choices by selecting radio buttons, explain how that data is retained so that the **Purchase Combo** button works correctly.
   > When the user makes choices via radio buttons in the Entrees, Vegetables, and Sides modules, event listeners detect the change event, retrieve the selected value from the DOM, and call the appropriate setter method to store that value in the `transient-state` module. Then, when the **Purchase Combo** button is clicked, an event listener triggers the `handlePlaceOrderClick` function, which calls `PlaceOrder`. This function takes the values from the transient state and saves them to the persistent state in the `database.json` file.

4. You used the `map()` array method in the self assessment _(at least, you should have since it is a learning objective)_. Explain why that function is helpful as a replacement for a `for..of` loop.
   > Using a `map()` function instead of a `for...of` loop is helpful for a few reasons.  Thereâ€™s no need to declare and `push()` elements to a new array, because `map()` automatically generates a new array, operates on each element of the original array, and pushes the elements to the new array.  This supports immutability and and cleaner, more readable code.
